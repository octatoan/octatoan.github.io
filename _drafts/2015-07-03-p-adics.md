The wonderful [Balarka](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/117002/balarka-sen) over at MSE was telling me a bit about the [p-adic metric]() and why one'd care about it.

A few definitions
-----------------

Quickly, a *metric space* is a set $A$ together with a *metric* $d:A\times A\to\Bbb R$, such that:

1. $d(x,y) = 0 \iff x = y$
2. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
3. $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$

where you are to sprinkle $\forall$s to taste.

Define \\[p^n \|\| x\\] for $p$ a prime if $n$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $x$.

We define the symbol \\[v_p(x) = p^{-n}\\] where $p^n \|\| x$. This is called a *p-adic valuation*.

Now define $d_p:\Bbb Z^2\to\Bbb R$ by \\[d_p(x,y) = p^{-v_p(x-y)}\\] which essentially says that two numbers are 'close' in some sense if their difference is divisible by a large power of $p$.

**Notational convention**. We write $\|x,y\|_p$ instead of $d_p(x,y)$.

**Exercise**. Prove that $\|\bullet,\bullet\|_p$ is a metric.
