title: A little about p-adics
---
The wonderful [Balarka](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/117002/balarka-sen) over at MSE was telling me a bit about the [p-adic metric]() and why one'd care about it.

A few definitions
-----------------

Quickly, a *metric space* is a set $A$ together with a *metric* $d:A\timesA\to\Bbb R$, such that:

1. $d(x,y) = 0 \iff x = y$
2. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
3. $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$

where you are to sprinkle quantifiers to taste.

Define $p^n |{} | x$ for $p$ a prime if $n$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $x$.
We define the symbol $v_p(x) = p^{-n}$ where $p^n || x$. This is called a *p-adic valuation*.

Now define $d_p:\Bbb Z^2\to\Bbb R$ by $$d_p(x,y) = p^{-v_p(x-y)}$$.

**Notational convention**. We write $|x,y|_p$ instead of $d_p(x,y)$.
**Exercise**. Prove that $|\bullet,\bullet|_p$ is a metric.
