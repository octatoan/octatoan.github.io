title: What I've been upto
---
It's been a long while since I posted here, so I think I should quickly go over what I'm busy with at the moment.

During the summer break, I developed a deep fascination with (for?) topology, and started studying 'proper' mathematics as best as I could. I've completed the first two chapters of *Chapter 0* (awkward, I know) and have learned a little category theory from a book that shall remain unnamed for now. In addition, I've started learning point-set topology from Munkres, after a long search for a 'magic bullet' that would quickly get me over the point-set basics and into magical fundamental group-land failed to return anything (although it did entail a brief three-minute encounter with Spanier!).

I'm really enjoying myself at the moment, even on the bus to school and back, where I solved three problems from my near-unrecognizable copy of Engel today, including a nice direct proof of the formula for the number of involutive permutations of an n-set:

\\[i(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} \binom{n}{2k}\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!} \\]

(Exercise to the bored reader: generalise to permutations with arbitrary prime order!)
