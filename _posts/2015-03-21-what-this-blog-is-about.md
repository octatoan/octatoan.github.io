title: What this blog is about

As part of post-finals euphoria (almost; Bio's tomorrow), I've decided to finally get started with two things I've been meaning to do for a long time: get into Haskell properly (i.e. beyond memoized Fibonacci functions and JSON parsers) and learn some more math.

In keeping with my "bite off e raised to whatever you think you can chew" policy, I plan to implement a sizable subset of Vim in Haskell, and work through Paolo Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*.

This blog will largely focus on my journey toward both of these goals, and everything else I pick up along the way. :)
