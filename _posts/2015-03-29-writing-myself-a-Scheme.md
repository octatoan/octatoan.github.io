title: Writing myself a Scheme
---
I've been looking for some Haskell project to take on ever since I finised LYAH. After my infamous second-term CS project (a BASIC interpreter in Java, of all things!), I'd always wanted to do something similar in Haskell, because parser combinators and Parsec are rad.

So I've been diligently doing [Write Yourself A Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), and it's been pretty cool so far. I've progressed as far the second chapter, and my toy Scheme interpreter can already parse most of the primitive datatypes -- and I think I'll end up learning Scheme too, in the process. It's pretty fun, and I'd wholeheartedly encourage anyone with an abiding love for parser combinators (I can't get enough of them; sorry) to try it too.
