      <p>I'm Soham, a math(s) and functional programming enthusiast.<p>This is mostly a log of my ongoing efforts to learn about fascinating things (mostly in mathematics). At the moment, I'm working toward learning enough to understand a little Galois theory and algebraic topology, with as heavy a dose of category theory as possible. (The title is warning enough, don't you think?)
      <p>Coherence or sensicality isn't guaranteed, but I'll try to be regular.
